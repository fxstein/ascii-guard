This is the inaugural release of ascii-guard, a zero-dependency Python linter designed to detect and automatically fix misaligned ASCII art boxes in text and markdown documents. Born from the common frustration of AI-generated documentation producing misaligned box characters, ascii-guard ensures your ASCII art remains visually perfect and professional.

The tool provides comprehensive detection of alignment issues across multiple Unicode box-drawing styles, with intelligent auto-fixing capabilities that preserve your intended formatting while correcting misalignments. The architecture is clean and modular, with separate detector, validator, and fixer components working together seamlessly.

This release includes extensive CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, comprehensive test coverage exceeding 90%, rigorous security scanning, and a battle-tested automated release process. With trusted PyPI publishing configured, comprehensive documentation (including usage guides, FAQ, and contribution guidelines), and support for Python 3.12+, ascii-guard is ready for production use. The tool has been tested across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of your development environment.
