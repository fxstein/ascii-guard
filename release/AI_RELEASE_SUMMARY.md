This is the first major release of ascii-guard, a zero-dependency Python linter designed to detect and automatically fix misaligned ASCII art boxes in text and markdown documents. The tool provides comprehensive detection of alignment issues across multiple Unicode box-drawing styles, with intelligent auto-fixing capabilities that preserve your intended formatting while correcting misalignments.

The release includes extensive CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, comprehensive test coverage exceeding 90%, and rigorous security scanning. The architecture is clean and modular, with separate detector, validator, and fixer components working together seamlessly.

With trusted PyPI publishing configured, comprehensive documentation, and support for Python 3.12+, ascii-guard is ready for production use. The tool has been tested across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of your development environment.
