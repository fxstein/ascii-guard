This release improves both user-facing documentation and the internal release workflow. Documentation has been updated to reflect the project's stable status, removing outdated alpha version references and correcting PyPI availability information. All pre-commit hook examples have been updated from v0.1.0 to v1.5.1, ensuring users reference the latest stable release with all bug fixes.

A new troubleshooting section addresses common user confusion about ignore marker syntax, clarifying that the correct marker is `<!-- ascii-guard-ignore -->` rather than the commonly mistaken `<!-- ascii-guard-ignore-start -->`. The FAQ has been updated to accurately document that file exclusion patterns are fully implemented via configuration files, correcting previous documentation that suggested this feature was still in development.

The release workflow itself has been improved to eliminate common errors encountered during the release process. The AI release summary is now committed to version history before running the prepare script, preventing "uncommitted changes" errors while maintaining the ability to diff summaries across releases. The freshness timeout has been increased from 30 to 60 seconds to provide a more reliable workflow.
