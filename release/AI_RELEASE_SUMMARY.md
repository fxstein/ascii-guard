This release adds native pre-commit hook support for ascii-guard. Projects can now include ascii-guard directly in their .pre-commit-config.yaml to automatically lint ASCII art box alignment in markdown files on every commit.

A bug report fix (issue #27) is also included, along with documentation improvements for the README Quick Start examples and Python API.

No breaking changes — this is a minor feature release adding ecosystem integration.
