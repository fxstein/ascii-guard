This is a test release to validate the dry-run functionality of the release process. The improvements include better error handling, process invalidation detection, and a simulation mode that allows testing the entire release workflow without actually pushing to GitHub or PyPI.

Key enhancements focus on reliability and safety, ensuring that the release process can be thoroughly tested before executing a real release. The dry-run mode provides visibility into exactly what operations would be performed.

This test validates that all release steps can be simulated successfully, building confidence in the release automation before using it for actual package distribution.
