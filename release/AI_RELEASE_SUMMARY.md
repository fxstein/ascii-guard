This is the first release of ascii-guard, a zero-dependency Python linter for detecting and fixing misaligned ASCII art boxes in text and markdown files.

The linter uses only Python's standard library and provides both detection and automatic fixing capabilities. It includes comprehensive CI/CD automation, extensive test coverage, and is ready for publication to PyPI.
