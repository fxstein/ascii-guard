# ascii-guard v0.1.0 - First Official Release

This is the inaugural release of **ascii-guard**, a zero-dependency Python linter designed to detect and automatically fix misaligned ASCII art boxes in text and markdown documents. Born from the common frustration of AI-generated documentation producing misaligned box characters, ascii-guard ensures your ASCII art remains visually perfect and professional.

## What Makes This Release Special

ascii-guard represents a complete, production-ready linting solution built entirely with Python's standard library. The tool provides comprehensive detection of alignment issues across multiple Unicode box-drawing styles, with intelligent auto-fixing capabilities that preserve your intended formatting while correcting misalignments. The architecture is clean and modular, with separate detector, validator, and fixer components working together seamlessly.

## Enterprise-Grade Quality

This release includes extensive CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, comprehensive test coverage exceeding 90%, and rigorous security scanning. The release process itself has been meticulously designed with environment validation, CI/CD gating, and zero-tolerance error handling to ensure every release meets the highest quality standards. Integration is seamless through pre-commit hooks, making it effortless to maintain documentation quality across your entire development workflow.

## Ready for Production

With trusted PyPI publishing configured, comprehensive documentation (including usage guides, FAQ, and contribution guidelines), and support for Python 3.12+, ascii-guard is ready to solve your ASCII art alignment problems. The tool has been tested across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of your development environment.
