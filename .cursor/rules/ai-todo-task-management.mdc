# ai-todo Task Management

**USE THE MCP SERVER** for all task management operations.

- Use `ai-todo` MCP tools (`add_task`, `complete_task`, `list_tasks`, etc.)
- **NEVER** use Cursor's built-in TODO tools
- **NEVER** edit TODO.md directly (protected by tamper detection)
- **ASK** before completing root tasks or archiving
- Tasks are displayed in **reverse chronological order** (newest on top)

The MCP server name is typically `ai-todo` or similar in your `.cursor/mcp.json`.
